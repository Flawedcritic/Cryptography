This was a project I did for my Cryptography module in university.
This is done entirely using python, using the math, sys and string libraries.
The first one encrypts and decrypts (with keys) using the affine cipher.
The second one decrypts Cipher text (Encrypted with Affine cipher) and uses the bruteforce method to decrypt it, it also finds the keys in the process.
